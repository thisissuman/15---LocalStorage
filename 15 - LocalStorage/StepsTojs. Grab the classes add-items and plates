1. Grab the classes add-items and plates.
2. in additem add submit event listener. and create a function.
3. to prevent the page reloading for every time we submit any item.
add the preventDefault() method to the parameter e of the function.
4. now take the text of the box and put it in an object. 
5.now create an item object which is going to have texxt : item name and done  : false. 
6.now we have to put some item into the text objet, so in order to do that we have to grab the 
input .
7. so grab the input by input element or [name=item]        
8. and the grab the value of it.
9. now put the value in object and add this.reset(); for clearing the input text each time we submit.
10. now push this object into an empty array. so create an empoty array  first. 


Now above we have done the data to insert in it, now lets work to prcess and show it in UI.

1. create a function which will create actual html here.
2. function populate, it needs two things.  first its needs list of plate to populate
which is items or plates. and 2nd we need a place to put the HTML and thats called platesList.
where we are going to pass in our itemlist(plate class grabbed constant.)
3. set the FIRST plates to empty array, so that when the function runs it will not break
if you are not passing anything, it will just loop over array of nothing.
4. and why need of creating this function is because if in future if we create another 
set of html items or another set of two differenet menu it will work fine.
5. go inside the function take the plates and map over it. (use map functon )
6. and return the ${plate.text} it will set to innerhtml of the plates
7. now call the function.

Now here we have to put checkbox also and link it to the label.

1.So in return statement add a new input for id = "item ${i}"
2. here in the above function in the map function we are mentioning two parameter one is plates, another is i,
3. it will be used to track the index of each itme also to map the input with label element.
